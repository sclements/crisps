        "content": "\n# Potato Chips\n**Origins:** The most popular legend attributes the invention of the potato chip to chef George Crum at Moon's Lake House in Saratoga Springs, New York, in 1853. A customer complained his french-fried potatoes were too thick, so Crum, in a fit of pique, sliced the potatoes paper-thin, fried them to a crisp, and salted them. The customer loved them, and 'Saratoga Chips' were born. **History of Popularity:** For decades, potato chips were a delicacy found primarily in restaurants. Mass production began in the early 20th century, especially after the invention of the mechanical potato peeler in 1925. Their popularity soared during World War II when the U.S. government declared them an 'essential food,' allowing factories to remain open. The post-war television boom cemented their place in American homes. **Today's Popularity:** Potato chips are arguably the world's most popular snack food, a multi-billion dollar industry with countless brands, flavors, and variations available globally.\n"

Tortilla chips were mass-produced for the first time in Los Angeles in the late 1940s by Rebecca Webb Carranza, who repurposed misshapen tortillas from her automated tortilla machine. **History of Popularity:** Fritos gained national popularity through savvy marketing, including a restaurant at Disneyland in the 1950s. Tortilla chips grew alongside the rising popularity of Tex-Mex and Mexican cuisine in the latter half of the 20th century, becoming inextricably linked with dips like salsa and guacamole. **Today's Popularity:** Corn-based chips, especially tortilla chips, are a staple snack in North America and are popular worldwide.
